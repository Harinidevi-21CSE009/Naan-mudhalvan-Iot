Project Objectives:
The project aims to develop a real-time parking availability system to benefit drivers by providing them with up-to-date information on available parking spots, thereby alleviating parking issues. Key objectives include:

Real-time data collection of parking spot availability.
Creating a user-friendly mobile app for drivers to access parking information.
Integrating IoT sensors for data collection.
Utilizing Raspberry Pi for data processing and server communication.
Implementing a reliable and responsive system.
IoT Sensor Setup:
To achieve real-time data collection, IoT sensors will be deployed in parking spaces. These sensors will utilize ultrasonic technology to detect the presence of vehicles. Here's a simplified diagram of the sensor setup:

Sensor Setup:
Mobile App Development:
The project includes the development of a user-friendly mobile app for both iOS and Android platforms. The app will offer the following features:

User registration and login.
Real-time map displaying parking spots.
Color-coded markers indicating spot availability.
Navigation to the nearest available spot.
Notifications/alerts when a parking spot becomes available.
Raspberry Pi Integration:
Raspberry Pi will act as the central hub for data processing and server communication. It will perform the following functions:

Collect data from IoT sensors.
Process and store data.
Communicate with the mobile app server through REST APIs.
Handle user requests and serve real-time data to the mobile app.
Here's a schematic representation of the Raspberry Pi integration:

Raspberry Pi Integration

Code Implementation:
The code implementation will involve several components:

IoT Sensor Code: The IoT sensors will transmit data to the Raspberry Pi, where it will be read and processed using Python or C++.

Raspberry Pi Code: The Raspberry Pi will run a Python script to:

Receive data from IoT sensors.
Update a database with parking spot availability.
Communicate with the mobile app server through RESTful APIs.
Handle user requests and provide real-time data to the mobile app.
Mobile App Code: The mobile app will be developed using a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter. It will communicate with the Raspberry Pi server via RESTful APIs to fetch real-time parking data and display it on the map.

Benefits:
The real-time parking availability system offers several benefits to drivers and parking management:
Time-saving: Drivers can quickly find available parking spots, reducing the time spent searching for parking, and helping to reduce traffic congestion.

Reduced Stress: Real-time information reduces frustration and stress associated with finding parking, leading to a more pleasant driving experience.

Environmental Impact: Reduced time spent circling for parking can lead to reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions, benefiting the environment.

Optimized Space: Parking management authorities can optimize parking space usage, potentially reducing the need for expanding parking facilities and utilizing existing resources more efficiently.
